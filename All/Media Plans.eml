Thanks Owen.

Below is an example of what needs to be clearer from a Media perspective.
To be honest, I have no idea what this means in terms of number of sites
currently installed and what is in the pipeline etc. It's all a bit
confusing and we need to start putting a Media Sales hat on in terms of how
we manage the inventory and what the pipeline is across the business. I
would like to suggest a weekly meeting with Tony to discuss Business
Development and how we can contribute from a Media Sales perspective.

It would be great to know the following:

Current Inventory
- Total number of buildings installed
- By location
- Total number of screens
- Total number of Apartments
- Split by utility partner

Pipeline
- Approved and awaiting installation (total number in pipeline)
- Priority installations
- Planned installs by week commencing
- Sites awaiting approval

The below summary does not make much sense to me.
Approvals 22
Closed Lost 13
Installation 7
MA Confirmation 42
Marketing Closed/Won 26
Non-Eris Deal 37
On Hold 1
Stock Selection 386
Survey 7
Grand Total 541

an example of what needs to be clearer from a Media perspective. To be hone=

e need to start putting a Media Sales hat on in terms of how we manage the =
inventory and what the pipeline is across the business. I would like to sug=
gest a weekly meeting with Tony to discuss Business Development and how we =
can contribute from a Media Sales perspective.=C2=A0</div><div><br></div><d=

Hi Tony

Further to this and for ease of checking, these are the sites which we will
leave on LDSK for the time being as they are either Xenia or ones that we
wish to keep as they meet our size/geo criteria.  Let me know if you think
any others should be on the keep list.  With all the rest removed (mostly
Eris), the LDSK monthly bill comes down massively but, as flagged, may
prompt the need for a senior level conversation with LDSK to agree a way
forward, given outstanding invoices and contractual obligations.

Xenia:

Budenberg*

Northill*

Adelphi Wharf 1*

Adelphi Wharf 2*

Adelphi Wharf 3*

Silkhouse Court*

Merebank Court*

Bridgewater Gate (Downtown)*

Victoria Mill*

East Point*

Other:

Sky Gardens Manchester
Tempus Tower Manchester
Lincoln Gate Manchester
Elisabeth Gardens/Mill Manchester
Wellington Buildings - The Strand Liverpool
Fox Street Village Liverpool
St Georges Gardens Manchester
Queens House Birmingham
Dock 5 Manchester
Sorting Office Building (Tempus) Manchester
Eye Witness Leeds
Regent Plaza Manchester

Plus Kings Chelsea.

Hi Tony

My view is that our site visits usually reveal that the problems aren't as
extensive as we are led to believe by them.  Often the reports come from
the BM 2nd hand via a concierge with the BM having not visited themselves,
and then what we find is different.

Last time, one outdoor media player had failed and one router inside -
this we know.  We got the router working again and Wez left with all bar
one outdoor playing.

The main problem last week was that they hadn't scheduled content. Their
previous campaigns had expired.   We have given them access and training
and someone in the marketing department had attempted to run a campaign but
not completed the process - Jane & I published it last week.

Putting myself in their shoes, they just want all the screens working again
consistently - I get that.  We have a plan for achieving that with Ian, but
part of it will be them using the CMS properly themselves.  Happy to offer
them some support with that initially.

Not sure how your idea of a separate MI server would work, but I don't
think they have the technical knowhow or appetite to set that up and
support it themselves going forward.  There's no getting away from the fact
that they need some new equipment - new media players and a supply of
routers that a local AV guy like Wez can replace when needed.  Longer term
they need hard-wiring or communal wifi.  Ian thinks the screens themselves
are ok.

We can discuss this again later today on Zoom?

D.

site visits usually reveal that the problems aren&#39;t as extensive as we =
are led to believe by them.=C2=A0 Often the reports come from the BM 2nd ha=

 we find is different.</div><div><br></div><div>Last time, one outdoor medi=

We have given them access and training and someone=C2=A0in the marketing=C2=

self in their shoes, they just want all the screens working again consisten=

 sure how your idea of a separate MI server would work, but I don&#39;t thi=
nk they have the technical knowhow or appetite to set that up and support i=

 that they need some new equipment - new media players and a supply of rout=
ers that a local AV guy like Wez can replace when needed.=C2=A0 Longer term=
 they need hard-wiring or communal wifi.=C2=A0 Ian thinks the screens thems=

Hi Dave,

It is disappointing to receive the email below and the language you use. We e=
ntered into an agreement as shareholders to grow the Company and one of the m=
ain premises of that agreement was the support Eris/E&J could provide to ena=
ble this.

As it stands today that support/help has been close to non-existent. We have=
 asked to progress the below on a number of occasions with little to no succ=
ess.

1. 22 Aviva sites to install screens - since October no progress and no meet=
ing with Aviva.
2. Screens in an Aviva building with no permission, no update as to what the=
 position is with these.
3. Instructed stock to be requested to pay =C2=A31 per apartment per month, p=
ushed back.
4. Introduction to Hyperoptic - not happened.
5. Introduction to MD=E2=80=99s/CEO=E2=80=99s of MA=E2=80=99s not happened.

We have been looking to grow the Company as a Proptech business against 2/3 w=
ell funded competitors, we have deals agreed such as Kings Chelsea, Urang an=
d Xenia with a number of others we are working through.=20

We have invested in developing a managing agent portal and always positioned=
 that =C2=A3750k was the requirement to grow the business.

The dispute and non payment from 4th utility has caused some major issues in=
 terms of the cash position of the business. We have reviewed their use of t=
he screens and they have posted campaigns 20 times? Since February the last o=
ne being the day before we met Steve Wilson. We have now compiled our positi=
on and have written to them today to request payment in full plus indicated t=
heir requirements under the contract.

We are keen to still look to progress and move this opportunity forward coll=
aboratively and a deal with landmark may be a good way for us to reset and m=
ove forward.

Let=E2=80=99s look to have the discussion face to face asap and agree a plan=
 for the next 3 months to show the opportunity deliver on the deals we have c=
reated and progress.

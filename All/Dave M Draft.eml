Redraft, thoughts - most important piece for me initially acceptance of =
restructure and majority management of the business.

Hi Dave,

I have dropped you a note re a catch up but have not heard back so =
wanted to confirm the team at IHM thoughts in terms of growing the =
business and what we would look to do on structure to achieve this.

Structure

DM & JT retain 12.5% each and 33% of any dividends moving forward

Amend shareholders agreement/Articles to move to a majority decision =
making process.

Dave Evans and Stephen Gale brough in as shareholders diluting Owen and =
Tony.

We approach 4th utility to take ownership of the current screens in =
situ.=20
=20
In terms of the current Eris stock with screens we see zero media value, =
we would suggest Eris would write to all their buildings/MA=E2=80=99s =
with a 2-month deadline to pay fees at =C2=A31/unit/month or screens =
will be removed. =20
=20
This effectively then becomes a 2-month trial period where we can sell =
the benefits (Jasmine has got materials from IHM already to do this), =
provide access to the system in the most resource-efficient way.  Those =
who don=E2=80=99t engage at all, or try it and decide against, will go =
on the list for removal based on a program we would need to cost out =
over time - we would first remove the sites with high screen: unit =
ratios as these are the most cost-effective to be removed via our =
partner.=20

Eris outstanding invoices to IHM converted to loan with an agreed =
interest position and would be a priority payment at a transaction.

We would provide s/w and service access for screens to be updated in =
Eris buildings but no charge to IHM moving forward and as above that =
where appropriate screens are removed over time.
=20
Our view is that the agreement of =C2=A350/screen was invalidated by =
Eris reneging on the guaranteed portal fees plus the end of the 4th U =
arrangement - but especially the former=20
It could become applicable again If MA=E2=80=99s anyone sign up to =
portal fees - providing these cover the =C2=A350/screen -  this is an =
opportunity to sell the benefit of the network for comms to MA=E2=80=99s =
and residents, plus the new services Eris is looking to take to =
buildings. =20

New deals - Xenia, KG G- networks will be signed and used as the basis =
for funding discussions moving forward. All these sites with the non =
Eris sites in Manchester/Liverpool we would keep and would begin to =
generate media income.

There is a platform built, website and collateral much has been learned =
and we have opportunities to grow moving forward and above protects the =
=C2=A3250k investment.

Be good to discuss so we can look to progress.


Best regards

New deals - Xenia, KG G- networks will be signed and used as the basis =
for funding discussions moving forward. All these sites with the non =
Eris sites in Manchester/Liverpool we would keep and would begin to =
generate media income.<br>
<br>
There is a platform built, website and collateral much has been learned =
and we have opportunities to grow moving forward and above protects the =
=C2=A3250k investment.<br>
<br>
Be good to discuss so we can look to progress.<br>

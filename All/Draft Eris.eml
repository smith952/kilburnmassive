Totally agree with all the above Tony. Surely Eris must understand that the=
 'goalposts' have been removed all together and effectively we have been le=
ft in the shit here. IHM can only pay Eris on screens that have potential m=
edia value and guaranteed revenue from the portal or amenity partners.

Ultimately, they should see the bigger picture and the fact they have an in=
vestment in IHM.

Hi Dave,

I think it will be worth a catch up re the historic 4th utility installed b=
ase of screens.

Contractually IHM organised the installation and wayleave we also provided =
software access to update the screens. IHM is not responsible for the the s=
creens uptime as they are still owned by 4th and access is via WiFi or a 4G=
 router, which again 4th own.

4th are aware of screens not on/not working as Jimmy accesses the platform =
regularly. We are planning on going back to 4th in strong terms this week d=
ue to the contract in place and the fact they have continued to upload camp=
aigns, the last being the 20th May. There complete disregard for uptime and=
 monitoring is quite astonishing.

In terms of our response as well as request for full payment of monies owed=
, we will provide a quote for removal and make good for screens from Eris b=
uildings.

In terms of this moving forward all screens installed by IHM are owned/run/=
maintained by IHM and we will not have the above issues.

As above my view is let=92s have a call to discuss, we have some good oppor=
tunities progressing/closed but want to ensure we are all on the same page =
with 4th on the historic element to close out.

Best regards

Tony

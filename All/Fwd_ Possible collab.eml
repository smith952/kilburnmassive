Hi Dave,

Likewise - nice to meet you.

Funnily enough I spoke with my client at MVN earlier today and she asked
for an intro so i'll email her shortly and copy you in.

I'll certainly bear you in mind when I'm speaking with current and future
clients and will make intros where I can.

Kind regards,

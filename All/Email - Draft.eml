Slight tweaked version below..


Hi Dave,


Further to my previous note in relation to In Home Media, we have clearly
not made progress since we first reached out in July with a view to a
viable plan to take the business forward. Due to this passage of time with
no progress made, both Stephen and Dave have left the business to pursue
other avenues in their career and both have confirmed that they will not
step back into the business in the future.


We are therefore no longer in a position to take the business forward and
we would welcome your input as shareholders (and due to the structure and
voting rights) and your agreement on closing the Company and/or leaving it
dormant.


Both Owen and I would also welcome a discussion to write off the loans. Our
view is that the ability to take the Company forward has been frustrated
due to elements outside of our control. We have both invested significant
time and effort without taking our payments over a significant period of
time. We have not encumbered the Company with these costs despite what was
agreed.


If you can come back with your thoughts and or a time for a call that would
be most helpful.


Best regards


Tony

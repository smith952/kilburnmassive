Hi Dave,

Not heard back from you on the below or the previous email in terms of a dis=
cussion.

The suggested changes would enable us to move the business forward which I a=
ssumed you would want to do.

If you can come back to me as leaving doing nothing is not a strategy that w=
ill provide success. As per my previous note screens are currently off and b=
lank which is far from ideal.

Best=20

Tony

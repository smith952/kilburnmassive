We tend to refer to this as 'media revenue' and not 'adverts'..

See below from 1st email:

*Many of these are low quality buildings with screens serving very few
customers and do not meet our quality threshold. Our desired ratio is 1
screen per 50 apartments, but currently we sit at approx 20:1. It would be
great to understand whether these buildings still hold a value to 4th
Utility in terms of increasing penetration, but I doubt this is the case.*

*Ultimately we want to find a position which is mutually beneficial to both
4th Utility and IHM, whereby the screen network can both drive revenue and
penetration. Clearly, the current situation is neither cost efficient nor
sustainable for either business, and we feel that this can be resolved for
the long-term benefit of us both. *

*I understand you have invested a lot of money in screens and I am
confident by being more strategic and allowing us input on the roll-out
plan, we can deliver an excellent ROI for you, and get closer to a cost
neutral position for 4th Utility.*

*To be clear, IHM would be prepared to move the screens FOC as long as they
meet the media value criteria of 50:1 apartments to screens.*


Reply email:


*I am keen for us to meet as I do have the best interests of 4th Utility at
heart as a shareholder, thus delivering value from the screen investment is
an area I am keen to progress. I do believe there is an opportunity to do
that if we work together over the coming weeks. IHM have wayleaves for all
buildings, plus the option to move screens to larger more premium sites
which support both media revenue and penetration that we can measure
on-going.*


*If we can come to an agreement on priority buildings to focus on going
forwards, I will be able to model these quite accurately from a media
revenue perspective. As there will be no charge to move the vast number of
screens *


*To be clear IHM are yet to launch our media offer - the 4th Utility
network as it stands currently does not have the scale to take to market,
but it does have several buildings of value, but we must move screens from
the lower end of the market where too many screens are serving too few
apartments. *




Jonathan, what do you think?


Thanks,

Owen

<span style=3D"font-size:10pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">I was=
 a founding shareholder in 4th Utility and continue to be a minority shareh=
older today. For the original shareholding, my Company Full Comms built the=
 website and ordering system at our risk to
 enable the Company to begin trading through automatic ordering via the web=
site. Once the DIF investment was made in August 2020 we received a payment=
 of =C2=A3250,000 for the work we had completed and transferred the IP to t=

 4th Utility with support/development of the website and marketing activiti=

 for screens into buildings, but it became apparent that although Wildstone=
 could deliver this, the ability to agree terms which worked for both parti=
es became problematic. At this stage the option of building a solution in a=
 similar way to support 4th Utility
 was explored, and eventually we agreed a way forward. I again invested in =
software development to support the delivery of the solution.<span style=3D=

<span style=3D"font-size:10pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">There=
 are a number of items to note; 4th Utility pulled out of developing a Mana=

 engagement is vital in buildings and ensuring
 leaseholder engagement. We as a Company played no part in the choice of 4t=
h Utility buildings for screen roll-out; as I previously stated since revie=
wing these sites, many have little to no value from both a media perspectiv=

the time were in discussions with other screen suppliers which would have m=

 be allowed in Eris buildings. It is also worth noting that 4th Utility had=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Hi Steve<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Firstly big congrats on reaching 10,000 customers - =
what a great achievement for you and the team. =C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I believe Jimmy has mentioned that I&#39;d like to h=
ave a chat about how best we move forward with the digital noticeboards tha=
t In Home Media is managing in 4th Utility sites. =C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">For the past several months we have carried out site=
 visits to a number of 4th Utility sites, and currently a good percentage o=
f the screens are placed in buildings which have no
 commercial value to IHM and are costing us both time and money to maintain=
 (Eris fees of =C2=A350/month per screen and CMS costs alone are making the=
se buildings loss making for IHM).=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Many of these are low quality buildings with screens=
 serving very few customers and do not meet our quality threshold. Our desi=
red ratio is 1 screen per 50 apartments, but currently
 we sit at approx 20:1. It would be great to understand whether these build=
ings still hold a value to 4th Utility in terms of increasing penetration, =
but I doubt this is the case.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Ultimately we want to find a position which is mutua=
lly beneficial to both 4th Utility and IHM, whereby the screen network can =
both drive revenue and penetration. Clearly, the current
 situation is neither cost efficient nor sustainable for either business, a=
nd we feel that this can be resolved for the long-term benefit of us both.=
=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I understand you have invested a lot of money in scr=
eens and I am confident by being more strategic and allowing us input on th=
e roll-out plan, we can deliver an excellent ROI for
 you, and get closer to a cost neutral position for 4th Utility.<u></u><u><=
/u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">To be clear, IHM would be prepared to move the scree=
ns FOC as long as they meet the media value criteria of 50:1 apartments to =
screens.<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I would also like to discuss a monthly discount on n=
etwork management fees in the non-Eris buildings.<u></u><u></u></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0<u></u><u></u></p>

There is a lot of detail there for sure.

I think they hit 10,000 customers not 1,000.

Our desired ration is 1 screen per 40 apartments

I think that if the intention is to get a face to face meeting, we should
just state that a good percentage of the current screens are placed in
buildings which have no commercial value to IHM and are costing us both
time and money to maintain. These are low quality buildings with many
screens serving very few customers and do not meet our quality threshold.
It would be great to understand whether these buildings still hold a value
to 4th in terms of increasing penetration.

It would be great to find a position which is mutually beneficial to both
4th and IHM, whereby the screen network can both drive revenue and
penetration. Clearly, the current situation is neither cost efficient or
sustainable and we feel that this can be resolved for the long-term benefit
of both companies.

Something like that?

 desired ration is 1 screen per 40 apartments</div><div><br></div><div>I th=
ink that if the intention is to get a face to face meeting, we should just =
state that a good percentage of the current screens are placed in buildings=
 which have no commercial value to IHM and are costing us both time and mon=
ey to maintain. These are low quality buildings with many screens serving v=
ery few customers and do not meet our quality threshold. It would be great =
to understand whether these buildings still hold a value to 4th in terms of=
 increasing penetration.</div><div><br></div><div>It would be great to find=
 a position which is mutually beneficial to both 4th and IHM, whereby the s=
creen network can both drive revenue and penetration. Clearly, the current =
situation is neither cost efficient or sustainable and we feel that this ca=
n be resolved for the long-term benefit of both companies.</div><div><br></=

Hi Ana,

Thank you so much for doing this. Jane is going to create a summary of the
screens/sites which we are not being charged for any longer and we can then
determine what the issue is (screens removed, sim cards etc)

I'll be in before lunch tomorrow.

<div dir=3D"auto"><br>
</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">It will be interesting to find out from LDSK where the di=
fference is in the 34 screens that have &#39;dropped off&#39; since Jan, as=
 undoubtedly most will be Eris/4th schemes. Eris will not know about which =
screens are live and not, except for the small
 number of building managers that contact them. I strongly suspect that the=
re are currently not 120 live Eris screens.</div>
<div dir=3D"auto"><br>
</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">Here&#39;s what we need to know in summary:</div>
<div dir=3D"auto"><br>
</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">- Total number of screens installed</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">- Total number of screens &#39;live&#39;</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">- Screens that are down (how many and where)</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">- Developments entered on LDSK, but no screens installed =
(clearly there must be some and these need to be removed)</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">- Total screens not entered on LDSK and/or Magic Info</di=
v>
<div dir=3D"auto"><br>
</div>
<div dir=3D"auto">This is pretty critical stuff to be honest, as we can&#39=
;t have any Media type conversations and send site lists etc until we have =
a complete understanding of the network. We can then take a judgement on wh=
at we do with 4th sites and specifically
 the stolen Sims.</div>

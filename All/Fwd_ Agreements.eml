Hi Both, so following discussions yesterday and today I am accepting =
their changes yesterday, save as below (one point to note is that I =
think we should get them to confirm that they are comfortable with this =
so with no voting and no dividends etc, to B shares and only A, that =
this qualifies for SEIS/EIS?) - to allow for the B Shares, I think the =
quickest way to get this done is to agree that these can be issued in =
the Shareholder Agreement asap after completion, and I have amended the =
Articles (which had at Article 13.2 a max number of shares of 200, to =
allow for the 50 A Shares for the future and to allow for James Acton =
and Steven Gale=E2=80=99s 18 B Shares, a change to a max number as =
follows (the red being the gist of the changes being made):

13.2=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0The authority referred to in =
Article 13.1: <>
13.1.1=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0shall be =
limited to a maximum nominal amount of =C2=A3200 of A Shares <> and =C2=A3=
18 of B Shares unless otherwise consented in writing by the holders of =
at least 76% in nominal value of the issued A Shares;


I made no other changes to the Articles.

In the Shareholder Agreement, I added this at clause 3 to allow the =
shortly following completion allotment of B Shares:

3.3       The Investors agree and authorise the Board that for the =
purposes of Article 13.4, on or as soon as possible after Completion, =
the Company shall be hereby authorised, subject to it entering into a =
written subscription agreement between the Employee(s) stated herein =
(including by them entering into a Deed of Adherence) and the Company, =
for those Employees to subscribe for B Shares from the date of =
subscription (but which allows for reverse vesting of B Shares, which =
reverse vesting shall be operative over three years from the date they =
became an Employee and which also allows for those B Shares to be =
converted into Deferred Shares as described herein) as to James Acton 11 =
B Shares with a subscription price per B Share of =C2=A31.00, and as to =
Stephen Gale 7 B Shares with a subscription price per B Share of =C2=A31.0=
0. =20



In respect of clause 10.7, I have redone this as follows:


10.7          In the event a Shareholder is in material breach of this =
agreement, which breach which is not remedied or can not be remedied =
within 14 days of the breach being notified to that Shareholder (it =
being understood that such delay of 14 days to remedy it (provided it is =
by then remedied) shall not be determined to be an irremedial breach =
itself because of the passage of time to remedy), that Shareholder shall =
be deemed to have served a Sale Notice under article 15 of the Articles =
in respect of all of his A Shares and article 15 shall apply to all of =
those Share and the Price shall be the Fair Value ((as calculated =
pursuant to article 16.4 of the Articles). In the event that, in respect =
of Owen Thomas or Anthony Hughes being in material breach of this =
agreement, but only in respect of one of them failing and/or refusing to =
adopt business plans whilst they are both a majority of the directors on =
the Board, which is not remedied or cannot be remedied within 14 days of =
that breach being notified to them (it being understood that such delay =
of 14 days to remedy it (provided it is by then remedied) shall not be =
determined to be an irremedial breach itself because of the passage of =
time to remedy), the applicable one or both of Owen Thomas or Anthony =
Huges who has failed and/or refused to so adopt a business plan, shall =
be deemed to have served a Sale Notice under article 15 of the Articles =
in respect of all of their A Shares and article 15 shall apply to all of =
those Shares except that the Price of those shares shall be 50% of the =
Fair Value (as calculated pursuant to article 16.4 of the Articles).=20

Can you please let me know instructions for me to share with Kelvin?

Best, Jonathan

Thanks for coming back.<br>
<br>
We are fine with moderated wording, key point is a breach must be =
material and not remedied within 14 days. Please suggest wording if you =
are not comfortable with material.<br>
<br>
We are fine with the issue of the two lots of B shares, we assume you =
are comfortable these are non voting, non dividend but share any =
exit/share sale proceeds? If happy please draft into the agreement.<br>
<br>
All the best<br>

<br>
Hi James and David,<br>
<br>
We have the agreements back from Kelvin, we are nearly there, just two =
items below we are keen to agree.<br>
<br>
1. Material breach we offered some words but this has been reinstated to =
the original words covering all breaches. Be good to have a compromise =
position.<br>
<br>
2. Share structure and details we are comfortable with. We do want to =
ensure on day 1 Stephen Gale has 5% B shares and Jimmy Acton 7.5% B =
shares. Stephen in our view is critical to the business moving =
forward.<br>
<br>
Owen and I are together tomorrow if a call needed to close off and move =
to signature.<br>
<br>
Best regards <br>
<br>
Tony<br>
